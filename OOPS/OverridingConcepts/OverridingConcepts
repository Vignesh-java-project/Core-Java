Overriding
    child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already
defined in its parent class.
    Methode signature need to be same.
    Runtime polymorphism (or) dynamic polymorphism.

Rules:
    In overriding methode resolution is always takes care by JVM based on
run time object instead of reference class.
        ex:
            Object obj = new String();
                obj.m1() -> always calls methode m1 in String class rather then calling
            m1 in object class Class methode.

Edge cases:
    1.Return type need to same or co-variant return types are allowed
    2.We can't reduce scope of access modifier in overridden methode. If need we can
    increase the scope in overridden method.
    3.If overriding methode throws checked exception then overridden methode should throw
    same or it's parent exception.
    4.But not same in un checked exception
    5.final methode can't be overridden.
