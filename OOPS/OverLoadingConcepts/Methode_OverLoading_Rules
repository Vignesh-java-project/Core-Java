Method Over Loading
    A class which has more then one methode with same name with different methode
signature (or) different arguments is known as overloading.
    Methode signature need to be different.
    Compile time  polymorphism (or) Static polymorphism.
Rules:
    In methode overloading methode resolution is always takes care by compiler based on
reference type.
    ex: Object obj = new String();
        obj.m1() -> always calls methode m1 in Object class rather then calling String
    Class methode.
Edge Cases:
    1.Auto Promotion case
        In overloading if exact match not available then compiler will auto promote the
    parameter to next type and checks for matching methode until all possible promotion.
    If there is no matching methode then only the Compiler raise the error.

    2.In the case methode with co-variant argument type always methode with child class
    argument will be execute.

    3.In the case var-arg methode as overloaded methode then exact match methode will get
    High priority. var-arg methode will get least priority.
